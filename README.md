# Homelab

> **Have fun. Sharpen the saw. Experiment with AI workloads.**

A home lab server built on a second-hand mini PC, running Ubuntu Server as the base OS. This is my sandbox — a place to tinker with technologies I don't use at work, self-host AI agents, and keep learning for the joy of it.

## Goals

- 🎮 **Have fun** — tinkering for the joy of it, no deadlines
- 🔧 **Sharpen the saw** — supplement and extend my Operations and DevOps expertise by running infrastructure hands-on
- 🤖 **Experiment with AI workloads** — run Hermes Agent with cloud/hybrid LLMs, and eventually local inference on dedicated hardware

## Selected Hardware

**Lenovo ThinkCentre M910q Tiny** — i5-7500T / 16 GB DDR4 / 256 GB SSD  
4C/4T, 35 W TDP, Intel HD 630 with QuickSync, ~7–10 W idle, ~150 EUR second-hand.
