# Homelab Setup — Docker Services Ansible Role

> Runbook for the docker_services Ansible role — deploys Portainer, Caddy, and Hello World on Cloudlab via community.docker.docker_compose_v2.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Ansible playbook running from the repo root (see [ansible/](ansible/README.md))
- [ ] docker_host role completed (Docker Engine + Compose plugin installed) — see [2-docker.md](2-docker.md)
- [ ] community.docker collection installed (nsible-galaxy collection install -r ansible/requirements.yml)
- [ ] SSH access to cloudlab via nsible_user: labadmin

## 1. Role Overview

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| nsible/roles/docker_services/defaults/main.yml | docker_dir: /opt/docker |
| nsible/roles/docker_services/tasks/main.yml | Create directory → template files → docker compose up |
| nsible/roles/docker_services/templates/docker-compose.yml.j2 | Service definitions: portainer, caddy, hello + homelab_net + volumes |
| nsible/roles/docker_services/templates/Caddyfile.j2 | Reverse proxy placeholder (DNS and TLS deferred to #23, #24) |

---

## 2. Services

| Service | Image | Port binding | Network |
|---------|-------|-------------|---------|
| Portainer | portainer/portainer-ce:latest | 127.0.0.1:9000:9000 | homelab_net |
| Caddy | caddy:2-alpine | 80:80, 443:443, 443:443/udp | homelab_net |
| Hello | `nginxdemos/hello:latest` | none (proxied internally) | `homelab_net` |

Portainer binds to localhost only — it is not exposed publicly. Caddy binds to all interfaces on ports 80/443 and serves the default welcome page until DNS and TLS routes are configured (see follow-up issues #23 and #24). The Hello container is only reachable internally via homelab_net; Caddy will proxy to it once routes are added.

---

## 3. Role Idempotency

The role uses community.docker.docker_compose_v2 with state: present and pull: always. On the first run it deploys all three containers; on subsequent runs with no config changes, it reports 0 changed. When the Jinja2 templates change, it recreates only the affected containers.

---

## 4. Playbook Integration

The docker_services role runs after docker_host in playbooks/playbook.yml:

`yaml
roles:
  - common
  - security
  - azure_arc
  - docker_host
  - docker_services
`

---

## 5. Verification Checklist

- [ ] Role is idempotent: second run reports changed=0
- [ ] Portainer running on localhost: docker ps --filter name=portainer → status Up, ports 127.0.0.1:9000->9000/tcp
- [ ] Caddy listening on port 80: curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' http://173.249.27.13 → 200
- [ ] Caddy listening on port 443: curl -sk -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' https://173.249.27.13 → returns HTTP code (no TLS cert yet, but port is open)
- [ ] Portainer NOT exposed publicly: curl -s --connect-timeout 5 http://173.249.27.13:9000 → connection refused or timeout
- [ ] All containers running: docker ps shows portainer, caddy, and hello all Up

## Next Steps

- **DNS A record** for cloudlab.cloud5.ovh → [#23](https://github.com/jaroslaw-bagnicki/Homelab/issues/23)
- **Let's Encrypt TLS** certs on Cloudlab → [#24](https://github.com/jaroslaw-bagnicki/Homelab/issues/24)
- Deploy additional microservices behind Caddy as they are added
