# Homelab Setup — GHCR Registry in Portainer

> Runbook for adding the GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) as a registry in Portainer CE.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Docker + Portainer CE running (see [2-docker.md](2-docker.md))
- [ ] Access to Portainer UI (via SSH tunnel: `http://localhost:9000`)
- [ ] GitHub account with access to the packages you want to pull

---

## 1. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token (Classic)

Portainer authenticates to GHCR using a **GitHub username + PAT (classic)** — not a fine-grained token. The token only needs `read:packages` scope to pull public or private container images.

1. Go to GitHub → **Settings** → **Developer settings** → **Personal access tokens** → **Tokens (classic)**
2. Click **Generate new token** → **Generate new token (classic)**
3. Fill in:
   - **Note**: `homelab-portainer-ghcr`
   - **Expiration**: 90 days (or custom — you'll need to rotate it)
   - **Scopes**: check `read:packages` (under the `write:packages` group)

   > If you also plan to **push** images to GHCR from this homelab, check `write:packages` and `delete:packages` instead.

4. Click **Generate token** and copy the token immediately — it won't be shown again.

## 2. Add GHCR as a Registry in Portainer

1. Open Portainer UI and navigate to **Settings** → **Registries**
2. Click **Add registry**
3. Select **Custom registry** as the provider (GHCR does not have a dedicated provider card)
4. Fill in the form:

   | Field | Value |
   |---|---|
   | **Name** | `GHCR` |
   | **Registry URL** | `ghcr.io` |
   | **Authentication** | ✅ Enable |

   | Field | Value |
   |---|---|
   | **Username** | Your GitHub username (e.g. `jaroslaw-bagnicki`) |
   | **Password** | The PAT (classic) from Step 1 |

5. Click **Add registry**

Portainer will test the credentials against `ghcr.io`. A green success message confirms the registry is reachable.

> **CE limitation**: The **Browse** button and registry access management are Portainer Business Edition features. In Community Edition (CE), you cannot browse registry contents from the UI, but you can still pull images by specifying the full image path (e.g. `ghcr.io/owner/image:tag`) — authentication and pulls work normally.

---

## 3. Verify It Works

### 3.1 Pull an image from GHCR

From the Portainer sidebar, go to **Images** → click **Pull image**:

1. Set **Registry** to `GHCR`
2. Enter the image path **without** the `ghcr.io/` prefix (Portainer prepends the registry URL automatically):

   ```
   jaroslaw-bagnicki/plutus-api:dev-1dc7962
   ```

The image should download successfully (no `401 Unauthorized` or `denied` errors).

### 3.2 Verify in the registry list

Go back to **Settings** → **Registries**. `GHCR` should be listed with the blue **authentication-enabled** badge.

---

## 4. Token Rotation

GitHub PATs expire. When the token expires:

1. Generate a new PAT (classic) with the same scopes
2. In Portainer, go to **Settings** → **Registries** → click **GHCR**
3. Update the **Password** field with the new token
4. Click **Update registry**

> Portainer does not support fine-grained PATs for Docker registries — only classic tokens work.

---

## Checkpoint

- [ ] PAT (classic) created with `read:packages` scope
- [ ] GHCR registry added in Portainer with blue "authentication-enabled" badge
- [ ] Successfully pulled an image from `ghcr.io` via Portainer UI
